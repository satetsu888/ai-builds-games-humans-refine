# Sound Design Guide

A guide for designing the sound layer of action mini-games using procedural audio generation in Godot 4.2+. Sound design derives its direction from visual tags — no separate sound tags are used. No external audio assets are required; all sounds are synthesized at runtime via GDScript.

## 1. Design Challenges

- Generating distinctive, satisfying sound effects without pre-recorded assets.
- Maintaining audio–visual coherence — sounds must feel like they belong to the same world as the visuals.
- Providing clear auditory feedback that reinforces (not duplicates) visual feedback.
- Keeping procedural audio code compact and performant within the mini-game scope.

## 2. Four Core Audio Principles and Evaluation Criteria

### (1) Event Clarity

- Principle: Every significant game event must produce a distinct sound. The player should be able to identify what happened by sound alone — scoring, failure, near miss, and game over must be aurally distinguishable.
- Evaluation: Can a player identify the event type with eyes closed? Are different event magnitudes (1 point vs. 10 points) audibly different?

### (2) Audio–Visual Coherence

- Principle: Sound style must match the visual identity. A neon-glow game should sound synthetic and resonant; a geometric-primitive game should sound clean and percussive. The visual tags drive both domains.
- Evaluation: Does the sound feel like it comes from the same world as the visuals? Would swapping in generic 8-bit sounds feel out of place?

### (3) Restraint

- Principle: Fewer, well-designed sounds are better than many generic ones. A mini-game needs 4–8 distinct sound events at most. Each sound should be short (50–500ms) and purposeful. Silence is a valid design element.
- Evaluation: Does any sound feel unnecessary? Is there sonic clutter during intense gameplay?

### (4) Dynamic Response

- Principle: Sounds should react to game state — pitch rises with combo multiplier, impact sounds scale with velocity, tension sounds intensify as difficulty increases. Static, unchanging sounds feel lifeless.
- Evaluation: Do sounds change with gameplay intensity? Can the player sense escalation through audio alone?

### (5) Semantic Lock (In-Game) and Variation (Cross-Game)

- Principle: Within a single game, each event family (`score / tension / failure / state change`) should keep a consistent timbral identity for fast recognition. Across different games, that identity must be redesigned from visual tags and game concept — not copied as a global template.
- Clarification:
  - **In-game fixed**: Event meaning ↔ timbre mapping stays stable during one game's session.
  - **Cross-game variable**: Waveform set, pitch range, envelope shape, modulation style, and rhythmic spacing should change per game.
- Evaluation: Is event meaning instantly recognizable in this game? Would this game's sounds be distinguishable from another generated game?

## 3. Visual Tag → Sound Direction Mapping

## 4. Sound Event Catalogue

Every mini-game should define sounds for the following events. Not all events apply to every game — select those relevant to the mechanics.

### 4.1 Core Events (Required)

| Event              | Purpose                | Typical Duration | Design Notes                                                      |
| :----------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Score gain**     | Positive reinforcement | 50–150ms         | Bright, upward pitch. Scale pitch/layers with point value.        |
| **Failure / loss** | Negative outcome signal | 200–500ms        | Low, dissonant, or noisy. Must contrast sharply with score sound. |
| **Game over**      | Terminal state         | 300–800ms        | Descending pitch or fade-out. Finality.                           |

### 4.2 Enhancement Events (Recommended)

| Event                     | Purpose          | Typical Duration | Design Notes                                                 |
| :------------------------ | :--------------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Near miss**             | Tension / reward | 50–100ms         | Subtle, quick. Pitched slightly lower than score sound.      |
| **Collision (non-fatal)** | Physics feedback | 30–100ms         | Short, percussive. Pitch/volume scales with impact velocity. |
| **State change**          | Mode transition  | 100–300ms        | Distinctly different timbre from other sounds.               |
| **Combo / multiplier**    | Escalation       | 50–150ms         | Same family as score but rising pitch with each step.        |
| **Charge complete**       | Action readiness | 100–200ms        | Bright ping after buildup.                                   |

### 4.3 Ambient Events (Optional)

| Event                | Purpose       | Typical Duration     | Design Notes                                           |
| :------------------- | :------------ | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Background drone** | Atmosphere    | Continuous / looping | Very low volume. Matches background visual style.      |
| **Difficulty shift** | Pacing signal | 200–400ms            | Subtle tonal shift. Player may not consciously notice. |

## 5. Procedural Audio in Godot 4.2+ — Implementation Guidance

All sounds are generated procedurally in GDScript. No pre-recorded `.wav`, `.ogg`, or `.mp3` assets are used.

This section focuses on design decisions. Template assets are the source of truth for implementation code.

- Waveform primitives and simple envelopes: `templates/godot-base/audio_synth.gd`
- Test-driven implementation examples: `tmp/games/<slug>/main.gd`, `tmp/games/<slug>/tools/tests/run_tests.gd`

### 5.1 Runtime Architecture (Recommended)

Use a hybrid approach by default.

1. **One-shot SFX (score / tension / failure / state change)**
   Use `procedural generate -> PCM cache -> AudioStreamWAV` as the default.
2. **Continuous controlled audio (engine / thrust / beam, etc.)**  
   First try `procedural generate -> PCM cache -> AudioStreamWAV(loop)`. If requirements can be met via `volume_db / pitch_scale`, use it as the default.  
   `AudioStreamGenerator` + `AudioStreamGeneratorPlayback` should be adopted only when real-time synthesis is indispensable.
3. Use `11025` or `22050` as baseline `mix_rate` (prioritize GDScript load).
4. For the same event, keep a fixed motif with small variation and avoid pure randomness.
5. **Prefer sample-capable paths**: Prefer streams playable as samples by `AudioStreamPlayer` (e.g., `AudioStreamWAV`) and avoid routine use of non-sample streams (mainly `AudioStreamGenerator`).

Implementation notes:

- Keep PCM cache in `PackedByteArray` (16-bit PCM), convert to `AudioStreamWAV`, and reuse.
- For continuous sound only, monitor `frames_available` / `get_skips()` and retry queues or adjust load when needed.

### 5.2 Event Semantics Lock (In-Game)

Lock the timbre mapping of `score / tension / failure / state change` within a single game.

- `score`: bright short tones with an upward or opening impression
- `tension`: mid-high noise or dissonant components signaling rising stakes
- `failure`: low-end leaning + short noise transient signaling negative outcome
- `state change`: independent motif indicating semantic transition (typically 120-350ms)

### 5.3 Variation Budget (Recommended Ranges)

Apply randomization only within ranges that preserve recognizability.

- Pitch detune: `±2%-±6%`
- Duration variation: `0-20%` of baseline
- Envelope variation:
  - Attack ratio: `±0.03`
  - Release ratio: `±0.20`
- Duty variation (square/pulse): `±0.03-0.12`
- Noise mix variation: `±0.05-0.15`

### 5.4 Continuous Sound Control (Engine/Thrust/Beam)

Control continuous sound in the following three stages.

1. Target: derive target gain/target pitch from input, velocity, and tension level
2. Smoothing: smooth with `current += (target - current) * alpha`
3. Release: after input release, apply ~100-250ms of decay

Operational rules:

- If `AudioStreamWAV(loop)` + `volume_db / pitch_scale` satisfies requirements, make it the first choice
- Specify stop conditions and stop method (gain decay only or with `clear_buffer()`).
- Avoid frequency-band conflicts between continuous and short sounds (prioritize score audibility)
- When adopting `AudioStreamGenerator`, explicitly document why WAV loop cannot substitute in `SOUND_DESIGN.md`.

### 5.5 Debug Checklist

- No sound:
  - One-shot SFX: Check PCM cache key resolution and `AudioStreamWAV.data` length
  - Continuous sound: verify `play()` -> `get_stream_playback()` -> `frames_available` order
  - Verify event-queue retry works for continuous sound
- Clipping/distortion:
  - Keep samples within `[-1.0, 1.0]`
  - Reduce noise mix ratio and simultaneous voice count
- Dropout:
  - Monitor `get_skips()` and adjust `mix_rate` / simultaneous voices / computation load

### 5.6 Performance Patterns

1. **High-frequency one-shots should default to cache**
   - Target: high-frequency, short one-shot SFX with small parameter variation
   - Recommendation: generate `procedural -> PCM cache -> AudioStreamWAV` at startup/load and select from pool at playback
   - Exception: allow runtime synthesis only when waveform itself must change significantly by immediate game state

2. **Separate local cooldown from global emission budget**
   - Per-event cooldown alone can cause a surge in simultaneous voices as event types increase
   - In addition to per-type control, combine `global cooldown` and `per-frame emission cap` to smooth peak load

3. **Use table-driven profiles in hot paths**
   - Store waveform/envelope/priority profiles in `const` tables and avoid per-call regeneration
   - Suppress hot-path `match`-based dictionary generation and excess temporary objects

4. **Continuous noise components need state-gating**
   - Do not keep noise components of continuous sound (engine/thrust/beam etc.) constant; gate by speed, tension level, and input state
   - Reduce constant noise feel in low-load states and preserve audibility of informational sounds (score/failure)

## 6. Procedure for Sound Design from Visual Tags

Design after visual design (Phase 3) is complete.

1. **Tag Interpretation**: Read each visual tag's `description` and `keywords`. Identify the sonic qualities they imply (refer to §3 mapping table).
2. **Cross-Tag Audio Synthesis**: Find the shared audio character across all selected visual tags. Express it in one phrase (e.g., "resonant synthetic pulses," "gritty percussive clicks").
3. **Waveform Selection**: Choose 1–2 primary waveforms and modulation techniques that match the direction.
4. **Semantic Timbre Mapping**: Define a stable in-game mapping for `score / tension / failure / state change` (same meaning, same timbral family).
5. **Cross-Game Variation Plan**: Explicitly decide what will vary versus previous games:
   - waveform palette
   - pitch range
   - envelope profile
   - modulation method (FM/AM/noise mix/filter sweep)
   - rhythm/gap pattern
6. **Event Mapping**: For each game event (§4), design a specific sound using the chosen waveform family and envelope style.
7. **Dynamic Parameters**: Identify which sound parameters should respond to game state (combo, velocity, difficulty).
8. **Continuous-Sound Policy** (if used): Define trigger condition, stop condition, and acceptable release tail.
9. **Integration Check**: Verify audio–visual coherence and event coverage with the checklist in §8.

## 8. Sound Design Quality Checklist

Confirm the following before completing sound design.

- [ ] Can the player distinguish all game events by sound alone (score, failure, game over)?
- [ ] Does the sonic style match the visual identity derived from the same tags?
- [ ] Are sounds short and non-overlapping during normal gameplay?
- [ ] Do at least some sounds respond dynamically to game state (combo, velocity, difficulty)?
- [ ] Is `score / tension / failure / state change` timbre mapping consistent within this game?
- [ ] Is there an explicit cross-game variation plan (not a reused global audio template)?
- [ ] Is variation kept within a defined budget (pitch/duration/envelope/duty/noise) so event identity remains clear?
- [ ] Is motif-first variation used (2–3 fixed variants + micro-variation), rather than pure random only?
- [ ] If continuous sounds are used, do they stop within the intended release time after input/state ends?
- [ ] Is there no sonic clutter — every sound serves a gameplay purpose?
- [ ] Are all sounds generated procedurally without external audio files?

## Appendix: Sound Anti-Patterns

Avoid the following:

### ❌ Generic Beeps

```
Using default sine wave beeps for all events.
Each event needs a distinct timbre, pitch range, and envelope shape.
```

### ❌ Audio–Visual Mismatch

```
Neon glow visuals with 8-bit square wave sounds.
Lo-fi jittery visuals with clean, smooth sine tones.
Sound direction must derive from the same visual tags.
```

### ❌ Constant Volume / Pitch

```
Score sound is identical whether scoring 1 point or 100.
Impact sound is the same at any velocity.
Dynamic parameters make audio feel alive and responsive.
```

### ❌ Global Template Reuse

```
Using the same score/failure/game-over timbres across multiple generated games.
Keep semantic consistency inside one game, but redesign timbre identity per game.
```

### ❌ Pure Random Drift

```
Adding large random variation every trigger with no motif structure.
Result: event identity becomes unstable and sounds feel accidental.
Prefer motif-first variation within a defined budget.
```

### ❌ Sound Spam

```
Every frame or minor event triggers a sound.
Reserve sounds for meaningful events. Silence between sounds creates contrast.
```

### ❌ Over-Long Sounds

```
A 2-second sound effect for a score gain in a fast-paced game.
Mini-game SFX should be 50–500ms. Longer sounds overlap and create mud.
```
